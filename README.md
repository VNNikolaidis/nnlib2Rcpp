# nnlib2Rcpp
An R package with Neural Nets created using nnlib2. 

---

This collection of artificial neural networks (NNs or ANNs or ANSs).
Currently includes versions of BP, Autoencoder, MAM, LVQ (supervised and unsupervised). 
All NNs were created using nnlib2 C++ library for implementing NNs and interfaced with R via RCpp.

I would like to add more classic NNs implementations in nnlib2 (and thus nnlib2Rcpp) but have limited time right now. Please let me know if interested to contribute.
